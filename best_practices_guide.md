# Code Fractalization Protocol: Best Practices Guide

## 1. Fractal Design Principles

### 1.1 Boundary Definition
When defining fractal boundaries, follow these guidelines:

- Base boundaries on cognitive load rather than line count
- Ensure each fractal has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Create boundaries that align with natural system divisions
- Consider the context requirements of AI tools
- Maintain consistent abstraction levels within each layer

Example of good boundary definition:
```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    """
    Fractal responsible for payment processing with clear boundaries:
    - Handles only payment processing logic
    - Depends only on payment-related services
    - Contains complete payment processing context
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.payment_service = PaymentService()
        self.fraud_detector = FraudDetectionService()
        self.transaction_logger = TransactionLogger()
```

### 1.2 Context Management
For effective context preservation:

- Document all architectural decisions with rationale
- Maintain clear parent-child relationships
- Track all cross-fractal dependencies
- Keep temporal context up to date
- Include performance and scaling considerations

Example context documentation:
```xml
<fractal_context>
    <decisions>
        <decision id="AUTH-001">
            <title>OAuth Integration Strategy</title>
            <context>Need to support multiple OAuth providers</context>
            <rationale>
                - Allows third-party authentication
                - Reduces security maintenance burden
                - Improves user experience
            </rationale>
            <consequences>
                - Must maintain provider-specific adapters
                - Increased integration testing needed
                - Higher initial development cost
            </consequences>
        </decision>
    </decisions>
</fractal_context>
```

### 1.3 Resource Management
Follow these resource management practices:

- Explicitly define resource boundaries and lifecycles
- Implement proper resource cleanup and disposal
- Monitor resource usage and performance
- Plan for resource scaling and optimization
- Handle resource contention gracefully

## 2. Contract Design

### 2.1 Interface Contracts
When designing interface contracts:

- Make all dependencies explicit
- Define clear input/output specifications
- Include performance requirements
- Specify error handling behavior
- Document version compatibility

Example contract:
```python
class PaymentContract:
    """
    Payment processing contract with explicit specifications
    """
    def process_payment(self, payment: Payment) -> PaymentResult:
        """
        Process a payment transaction
        
        Requirements:
        - Must complete within 2000ms
        - Must be idempotent
        - Must handle network failures
        
        Version: 2.0.0
        Breaking changes from 1.x:
        - Added support for multiple currencies
        - Changed error response format
        """
        pass
```

### 2.2 Resource Contracts
For resource contracts:

- Specify resource requirements clearly
- Define access patterns
- Include scaling requirements
- Document cleanup responsibilities
- Specify monitoring requirements

### 2.3 Evolution Management
When evolving contracts:

- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Provide migration paths
- Include version compatibility matrices
- Implement proper deprecation cycles

## 3. Development Practices

### 3.1 Code Organization
Follow these organization principles:

- Keep fractal implementations focused
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Include comprehensive logging

Example organization:
```python
class UserAuthFractal:
    def __init__(self):
        # Core dependencies
        self.auth_service = AuthenticationService()
        self.user_store = UserStorageService()
        
        # Logging and monitoring
        self.logger = Logger(__name__)
        self.metrics = MetricsCollector()
        
        # Contract verification
        self.contract_verifier = ContractVerifier()
```

### 3.2 Testing Strategy
Implement comprehensive testing:

- Write tests at all fractal levels
- Include contract verification tests
- Implement performance tests
- Add security testing
- Use property-based testing where appropriate

Example test structure:
```python
class PaymentProcessorTests:
    def test_contract_compliance(self):
        """Verify payment processor meets its contract"""
        processor = PaymentProcessor()
        verifier = ContractVerifier(PaymentContract)
        assert verifier.verify(processor)
    
    def test_performance_requirements(self):
        """Verify performance meets contract requirements"""
        with Performance() as p:
            self.processor.process_payment(self.sample_payment)
        assert p.duration < 2000  # Must complete within 2000ms
```

            'error_rate': CounterMetric(),
            'resource_usage': GaugeMetric(),
            'contract_violations': CounterMetric()
        }
        
    def record_operation(self, operation_name, duration, status):
        self.metrics['response_time'].record(duration)
