# Code Fractalization Protocol Glossary

## A

### Architectural Change
A change that affects multiple fractal layers or the overall system architecture. These changes typically require careful planning and coordination across multiple teams.

### Artifact
A discrete piece of work product within a fractal, such as source code, documentation, or test cases.

## B

### Behavioral Contract
A specification that defines the expected behavior, operation sequences, and performance constraints of a fractal.

### Boundary
The defined interface and scope limits of a fractal, establishing what is internal versus external to the fractal's responsibility.

## C

### Change Propagation
The process by which changes in one fractal affect other related fractals through their defined relationships and contracts.

### Cognitive Load Boundary
A boundary defined based on the mental effort required to understand and work with a component, used to ensure each fractal represents a manageable cognitive unit.

### Contract
A formal specification of a fractal's interfaces, behaviors, and resource requirements. Contracts form the basis of fractal interactions.

### Contract Evolution
The process of modifying contracts over time while maintaining system stability and backwards compatibility where required.

### Context Layer
The part of a fractal that maintains historical decisions, architectural reasoning, and evolution history.

### Context Window
The amount of context that can be processed at once by AI tools working with the system.

## D

### Dependency Graph
A directed graph representing the relationships and dependencies between fractals in the system.

### Domain Fractal
A fractal that encapsulates a specific business or technical domain within the system.

### Domain-Driven Decomposition
A system decomposition approach that organizes fractals based on business domain boundaries and ubiquitous language.

## E

### Evolution History
The documented record of how a fractal has changed over time, including architectural decisions and their rationale.

### External Contract
A contract that defines how a fractal interacts with components outside the fractal system.

## F

### Fractal
The fundamental organizational unit in the protocol, consisting of implementation, data, and knowledge layers.

### Fractal Boundary
The defined interface and scope limits of a fractal, establishing what is internal versus external to the fractal's responsibility.

### Fractal Context
The combination of vertical, horizontal, and temporal context that provides complete understanding of a fractal's role and history.

## H

### Horizontal Context
Information about a fractal's relationships with peer components, including shared resources and dependencies.

## I

### Impact Analysis
The process of evaluating how changes to one fractal might affect other parts of the system.

### Implementation Layer
The part of a fractal containing the actual code and its immediate documentation.

### Interface Contract
A specification defining the inputs, outputs, and types that a fractal exposes to other fractals.

### Isolated Change
A change that affects only the internal implementation of a fractal without impacting its interfaces.

## K

### Knowledge Layer
The part of a fractal that maintains context, reasoning, and historical decisions.

## L

### Lifecycle Hook
A defined point in a resource's lifecycle where custom behavior can be implemented.

## M

### Migration Path
A defined process for transitioning from one version of a contract or implementation to another.

### Mutation Testing
A testing approach that modifies code in specific ways to verify test coverage and effectiveness.

## P

### Performance Contract
A specification of the expected performance characteristics and constraints of a fractal.

### Property-Based Testing
A testing approach that verifies that general properties of a system hold true across many possible inputs.

### Probabilistic Impact Analysis
A system that uses statistical modeling and machine learning to predict the likely effects of changes.

## R

### Resource Contract
A specification defining how a fractal interacts with and manages system resources.

### Resource Lifecycle
The complete lifecycle of a resource from acquisition through disposal, including all intermediate states.

### Responsibility-Based Decomposition
A system decomposition approach that organizes fractals based on clear functional responsibilities and accountability.

## S

### Security Boundary
A defined perimeter within which specific security controls and policies apply.

### State Recovery
The process of restoring a fractal or system to a known good state after an error or failure.

### State-Based Decomposition
A system decomposition approach that organizes fractals based on state management requirements and data consistency boundaries.

## T

### Temporal Context
Information about how a fractal has evolved over time, including architectural decisions and their rationale.

### Test Suite
A collection of tests that verify a fractal's compliance with its contracts and expected behavior.

## V

### Validation
The process of verifying that a fractal meets its specified requirements and contracts.

### Vertical Context
Information about a fractal's relationships with its parent and child components in the system hierarchy.

### Version Compatibility Matrix
A document specifying which versions of different fractals and contracts are compatible with each other.

## General Terms

### AI Integration
The incorporation of artificial intelligence capabilities into the fractal system, including context provision and output validation.

### Contract Violation
A situation where a fractal's behavior does not comply with its specified contracts.

### Context Window
The amount of context that can be processed at once by AI tools working with the system.

### Resource Contention
A situation where multiple fractals compete for access to shared resources.

### Technical Debt
Accumulated technical compromises that may need to be addressed in future development.

## Metrics and Quality Attributes

### Contract Compliance Score
A metric indicating how well a fractal adheres to its specified contracts.

### Cognitive Load Score
A metric measuring the mental effort required to understand and work with a fractal.

### Impact Score
A metric indicating the likely extent of a change's effects on the system.

### Resource Utilization
A measure of how effectively a fractal uses its allocated resources.

### System Health Score
A composite metric indicating the overall health of the fractal system.
